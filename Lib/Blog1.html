               Such are the phrases we associate Motherhood with. But is that really true? Do all women enjoy motherhood as much as we think they do and is it last thing they are looking for? To be contented with? Well, the answer is Harsh NO.Please don’t be judgmental.  It’s not that they don’t want a baby or not ready to the responsibility of a sapling which is so tiny and yet so beautiful.  May be they didn’t foresee the journey ahead. May be they didn’t prepare themselves well.

            <p style="font-size: 100%;" class="blog-style"><em>“Don’t fear Childbirth,that’s the easy part,there is no Epidural for Motherhood”</em>

            </p>

            <p style="font-size: 100%;" class="blog-style">Motherhood is hard and exhaustive which ironically is fulfilling and rewarding at the same time. We believe that giving birth is the toughest thing in the world but who knows about the long journey that’s planned ahead? It’s the Mother. She has the responsibility to transform an untamed tiny creature to a responsible human being. But not every woman is ready to sacrifice her dreams and we should respect her decision.

            </p>
  
   <p style="font-size: 100%;" class="blog-style">Once a woman decides and transforms to a mother, her perspective about life changes. Everything starts revolving around the baby  But all this takes time.With Gush of hormones, emotions flow freely, she wants to cry while she is happy, she screams for no reason. What makes it worse when she and her family are not even aware that Postpartum Depression exists.

  <p style="font-size: 100%;" class="blog-style">Both working mom or SAHM (stay-at-home-mom), have their share of Mommy Guilt moments where they wish to send their child to school on a holiday or want them to oversleep on weekends. Sometimes, they would drop a kid to their grandparents giving Doctor’s visit excuse while what they wanted is some alone time, may be at café or salon.

    <p style="font-size: 100%;" class="blog-style">As Indra Nooyi once said” Women can’t have it all”. You need to prioritize many things, sometimes many times a day. Just try and find a Coping mechanism. You don’t have to die of guilt. Take inspiration from other women, when she can do it, why can’t you!!! Remember you are not a Superwoman who can do it all alone.When they say “It takes a village to raise a child” , it means something.

   <p style="font-size: 100%;" class="blog-style">Keep it your way. That’s the Best way!!!
