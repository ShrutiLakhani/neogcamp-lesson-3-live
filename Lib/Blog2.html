            <em>"The moment a child is born, the mother is also born. She never existed before. The woman existed but the mother, never. A mother is something absolutely new"</em>
 
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 100%;">
                Do we all agree? Then why are our expectations not aligned with our thoughts? Why do we expect a woman who just entered motherhood to have emotions and expertise to raise a child like she was born for it? To have some kind of Superpowers or a Magic wand? 

 
            </p> 
            
            <p style="font-size: 100%;">Wish we all could have superpowers or a magic wand to transform the world around us into a fairyland.  But let’s face the truth. Every transformation takes time. Be it a girl transforming to a woman or a woman to a mother.  Her body was working 24*7 for 9 months, manufacturing baby.  It involves moving through many changes, both emotionally and physically. She needs good care to rebuild her strength. 


            </p>
  
            <p style="font-size: 100%;">Our society has many norms for a new mother which she must fulfill else she will be judged. How the baby turns out defines how good or bad the mother is. Yes, Parenting does have an impact but won’t you agree that her psychological being affects her parenting. 


         <p style="font-size: 100%;"><em>Being a mother is LEARNING about the STRENGTHS you didn't know you had and DEALING with FEARS you didn't know exsited"!!!</em>
